//! Node execution: the [`NodeExecutor`] trait and per-kind implementations.
//!
//! Each [`crate::model::NodeKind`] maps to a `NodeExecutor`. Native control-flow
//! nodes live in [`control_flow`]; capability-backed nodes (which call the host
//! via [`crate::caps`]) live in [`integration`]. Implementations are stubbed in
//! this skeleton and completed in stages A2–A3 (see `docs/08-roadmap.md`).
